--
--   * Deriving instances
--   * Using typeclasses methods
--   * Implementing instances manually
--   * Becoming friends with Semigroup, Monoid, Foldable and Functor typeclasses!

-- | Let's define a simple enumeration data type for representing days
-- of the week.
data Weekday
  = Monday
  | Tuesday
  | Wednesday
  | Thursday
  | Friday
  | Saturday
  | Sunday
  deriving (Show, Eq, Enum, Bounded, Ord)

-- | Write a function that will display only the first three letters
-- of a weekday.

-- >>> toShortString Monday
-- "Mon"
toShortString :: Weekday -> String
toShortString = take 3 . show

-- | Write a function that returns next day of the week, following the
-- given day.
--
-- >>> next Monday
-- Tuesday
--
-- ♫ NOTE: Implement this function without pattern matching on every
--  constructor! Use standard typeclasses instead (you may need to derive
--  them first).
--
-- 🕯 HINT: Check 'Enum' and 'Bounded' typeclasses.
--
-- 🆙 Bonus challenge 1: Could you implement this function in a such way
--  that it'll still work even if you change constructor names and their
--  order in the 'Weekday' type?
--
-- 🆙 Bonus challenge 2: Now, could you improve the implementation so it
--  would work for **any** enumeration type in Haskell (e.g. 'Bool',
--  'Ordering') and not just 'Weekday'?

In the following block of tasks you need to implement 'Semigroup'
instances for all types and 'Monoid' instances if it's possible to
have a lawful 'Monoid' instance.

  }

  first <> second =
    Gold $ unGold first + unGold second

  mempty = Gold 0

-- | A reward for completing a difficult quest says how much gold
-- you'll receive and whether you'll get a special reward.

-- If you combine multiple rewards, the final reward will contain a
-- special prize if at least one of the rewards is special.
data Reward = Reward
  { rewardGold :: Gold,
    rewardSpecial :: Bool
  }
  deriving (Show, Eq)

  first <> second =
    Reward (rewardGold first <> rewardGold second) (rewardSpecial first || rewardSpecial second)

  mempty =
    Reward mempty False

-- | 'List1' is a list that contains at least one element.
data List1 a = List1 a [a]
  deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | This should be list append.

-- | When fighting a monster, you can either receive some treasure or
-- don't.
data Treasure a
  = NoTreasure
  | SomeTreasure a

-- | When you append multiple treasures for fighting multiple
-- monsters, you should get a combined treasure and not just the first

In the next block of tasks, implement 'Foldable' instances for all
types that can have such an instance.

♫ NOTE: Implement both 'foldr' and 'foldMap' methods. On the one hand,
  'Foldable' is a big typeclass but lets focus on its small part to get
  the main idea. On the other hand, these two methods are quite
  different so it's a good practice.

🕯 HINT: Check kinds of types to see whether it's possible to implement
  an instance of 'Foldable'.

🕯 HINT: If you don't feel comfortable with kinds yet, alternatively
  you can try uncommenting each instance one by one and see the GHC
  error. The compiler will "kindly" tell you if it's impossible to have
  such an instance.

🕯 HINT: Write explicit type signature of methods using InstanceSigs
  (already enabled in this module).

♫ NOTE: Since the instances are commented, the tests are also commented.
  To run tests for your instances, go to the "test/Test/Lecture3.hs" file
  and uncomment all commented tests. But do this only after you
  implement instances! No spoilers :)

  foldr fun acc (List1 x xs) =
    foldr fun acc (x : xs)

instance Foldable Treasure where
  foldr _fun acc NoTreasure = acc
  foldr fun acc (SomeTreasure a) = fun a acc

{-

In the next block of tasks, implement 'Functor' instances for all
types that can have such an instance.

🕯 HINT: At this point, you already know which types can have 'Functor'
  instance and which don't (the same types as for 'Foldable' in this
  case). But comments still mention all types to avoid spoilers ;)

-- | Functions are first-class values in Haskell. This means that they
-- can be even stored inside other data types as well!
--
-- Now, you have a function inside some 'Functor'. You're a given an
-- element and you need to apply the function inside the 'Functor' to a
-- given element.
